# About sections

*sections* is a Python package for calculating physical properties of planar
shapes. The physical properties include area, position of centre of gravity,
moments of inertia and more.

The package comes with several predefined basic shapes (e.g. polygon,
circle, rectangle, etc.) and some more complex shapes (e.g. I-profiles,
RHS-profiles). They can be easily combined to create to create any shape you
might need.

The package depends on numpy and matplotlib for creating plots of the shapes.
Other than that there are no dependencies.
